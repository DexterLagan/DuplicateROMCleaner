# Duplicate ROM Cleaner (PowerShell)

A powerful PowerShell script for finding and removing duplicate files on any disk drive. This command-line tool identifies files that exist both as compressed `.zip` archives and as standalone files with other extensions, helping you reclaim storage space while maintaining data integrity. Perfect for ROM collections, media archives, and automated cleanup workflows.
A cross-platform Python prototype (`duplicate-cleaner-py.py`) is included for CRC-based duplication checks and runs with Python 3.8 or newer.

## üéØ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Duplicate Detection**: Finds files with identical basenames where one is a `.zip` and another has a different extension
- **Content Verification**: Validates that duplicate files actually exist inside ZIP archives with matching file sizes
- **Orphan File Compression**: Automatically compresses standalone files (without corresponding ZIPs) into individual ZIP archives
- **Multi-Extension Support**: Handles any file extensions (`.rom`, `.stm`, `.mp3`, `.pdf`, etc.) alongside ZIP files

### Command-Line Power
- **Dry Run Mode**: Default safe mode that previews changes without executing them
- **Batch Processing**: Process entire drives automatically with command-line parameters
- **Scriptable**: Integrate into automated workflows and batch files
- **Per-Folder Confirmation**: Interactive mode with confirmation for each folder
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive console output with colored status messages

### Safety Features
- **Double Confirmation**: Two-level confirmation system prevents accidental deletions
- **Protected Directory Handling**: Automatically skips system and hidden directories
- **Drive Selection GUI**: Interactive dropdown for selecting target drives
- **Verification Checks**: Ensures ZIP contents match before any deletions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from access issues

## üìã How It Works

### Duplicate Detection Process
1. **Recursive Scanning**: Walks through all directories on the selected drive
2. **File Grouping**: Groups files by basename (filename without extension)
3. **ZIP Matching**: Identifies groups containing both `.zip` files and other extensions
4. **Content Verification**: Extracts and compares file sizes to ensure actual duplicates
5. **Safe Deletion**: Only deletes verified duplicates after user confirmation

### Orphan Processing
1. **Orphan Identification**: Finds files without corresponding ZIP archives
2. **Individual Compression**: Creates separate ZIP file for each orphan
3. **Integrity Verification**: Confirms successful compression before deleting originals
4. **Rollback Protection**: Keeps originals if compression fails

### Example Scenario
```
Before:
E:\ROMS\arcade\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pacman.zip      (contains pacman.rom)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pacman.rom      (duplicate - will be deleted)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ galaga.zip      (contains galaga.rom)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ galaga.rom      (duplicate - will be deleted)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pinball.rom     (orphan - will be compressed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.txt      (no ZIP pair - ignored)

After:
E:\ROMS\arcade\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pacman.zip      (unchanged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ galaga.zip      (unchanged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pinball.zip     (newly created from pinball.rom)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.txt      (unchanged)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```powershell
# Download the script
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[your-username]/duplicate-rom-cleaner/main/duplicate-cleaner.ps1" -OutFile "duplicate-cleaner.ps1"

# Run in safe dry-run mode
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1
```

### Option 2: Direct Execution
```powershell
# Execute with orphan compression
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -Execute -CompressOrphans

# Dry run with orphan compression preview
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -CompressOrphans
```

### Option 3: One-Click Batch File
Create `CleanROMs.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "duplicate-cleaner.ps1" -Execute -CompressOrphans
pause
```

### Option 4: Python Prototype
```bash
python duplicate-cleaner-py.py PATH_TO_DRIVE_OR_FOLDER [-e] [-c]
# Example: process drive D with deletion and compression
python duplicate-cleaner-py.py D:\\ -e -c
```

## üìñ Usage Instructions

### Command-Line Parameters
```powershell
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 [Parameters]

Parameters:
  -Execute           Actually perform deletions (default: dry run only)
  -CompressOrphans   Enable orphan file compression to ZIP
```

### Usage Examples
```powershell
# Safe preview mode (default)
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1

# Preview with orphan compression
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -CompressOrphans

# Execute duplicate removal only
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -Execute

# Full cleanup: duplicates + orphan compression
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -Execute -CompressOrphans
```

### Interactive Workflow
1. **Drive Selection**: GUI popup shows available drives (D: and above)
2. **Folder Processing**: Script processes each folder individually
3. **Results Display**: Shows found duplicates and orphans with file sizes
4. **Confirmation Prompts**: 
   - First confirmation: "Delete these X files?"
   - Second confirmation: "Are you REALLY sure?"
5. **Progress Updates**: Real-time status with colored output
6. **Final Summary**: Total statistics at completion

### Sample Output
```

The script can be modified to:
- Skip specific file extensions
- Process only certain folder patterns
- Add custom compression levels
- Implement size-based filtering

### Logging Output
```powershell
# Save log to file
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -Execute 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath "cleanup-log.txt"

# Detailed timestamps
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -Execute | ForEach-Object { "$(Get-Date): $_" }
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Execution Policy Errors**
```
Solution: Use -ExecutionPolicy Bypass parameter or set RemoteSigned policy
```

**Access Denied Errors**
```
Behavior: Script automatically skips and continues - this is normal
Common Causes: System folders, encrypted files, files in use
```

**ZIP Verification Failures**
```
Behavior: Files are kept safe, warnings displayed
Common Causes: Corrupted archives, incomplete downloads
```

**Drive Not Listed**
```
Cause: Only drives D: and above are shown (excludes system drive C:)
Solution: This is by design for safety
```

### Debug Mode
```powershell
# Enable detailed debug output
$DebugPreference = "Continue"
.\duplicate-cleaner.ps1 -Execute -CompressOrphans
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Large Collections**: Process subfolders individually
- **Network Drives**: Ensure stable connections
- **Low Memory**: Close other applications during processing
